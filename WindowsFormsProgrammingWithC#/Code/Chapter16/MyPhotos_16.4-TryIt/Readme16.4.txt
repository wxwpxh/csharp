I implemented the TRY IT! for section 16.4 in a slightly unique way.  Rather than creating a new context menu in the Parent form, I simply arrange for the MDI Client to display the existing ctxtMenuImage menu underneath a new dropdown toolbar button.  Check out the toolBarParent_ButtonDropDown event handler implementation for details.
