This directory contains the code for the TRY IT! paragraph in section 12.1 of the book.  One interesting feature of our implementation is the use of the "goto case" statement to jump from one case block to another in a switch statement.  See the code for how this is done.

For questions and comments on this code, please visit the Author Online forum available at http://www.manning.com/eebrown.
