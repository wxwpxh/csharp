This directory contains the code from Chapter 14 of the book.  A separate directory exists for each section in the chapter.  Each of these section directories contains the MyAlbumExplorer and MyPhotoAlbum projects.  Double-click the MyAlbumExplorer.sln in the MyAlbumExplorer directory to open the solution.

An implementation of the TRY IT! section in this chapter is also provided here.

Also note that the Application Icon used here is based on the common graphics provided with Visual Studio .NET.  This is stored as a relative path from the MyAlbumExplorer directory, and as a result would not likely work when compiled on your computer.  For this reason, the application icon was removed from the example code.  The application icon can be added to the program as described in the book.

For questions and comments on this code, please visit the Author Online forum available at http://www.manning.com/eebrown.
